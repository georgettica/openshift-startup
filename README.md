This repo will hold the changes made on the osboxes.org debian 8 machine to run ` oc cluster up` successfully`

for running the system, I installed the packages from [packages list file](./installed-packages.txt)

# Installing oc binary
installed from [github openshift release](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.7.0)
the package is named : 'openshift-origin-client-tools-v3.7.0-7ed6862-linux-64bit.tar.gz' 

extracted it with `tar xzvf <file.tar.gz>`

copied it to /usr/local/bin
